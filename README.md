# Phase 3 Sinatra React Project Front End

This is the React frontend for my Phase 3 Project. The project is a single page application centered on musical artists, their songs, and the covers they've done of other artist's songs.

## Installation

Fork and clone, then run: 
```
npm install
```
in the project's directory to install the necessary npm packages. Next, run:
```
npm start
``` 
to start the app in development mode on a local port and open the app in your browser. (You will also need to run a rake server and seed the database so the frontend has a server with data it can talk to! Instructions for that will be in the back end directory's readme!)

## Usage

Feel free to play around with it! The app includes full CRUD capabilities for the data related to each artist, their songs and their covers of songs through the various routes within the app.

## Credits and Sources
This app uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) for its frontend,specifically [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to set up the initial starter code for the React program.

It also uses [the phase 3 project code by lizbur10 on github](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-3-sinatra-react-project) to set up the initial backend directory, which uses both [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/) and [Active Record](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) to build out the database functionality.

All song performances in the seed data have been sourced from YouTube and can be found at the following locations:

This project was done for Phase 3 of the Flatiron School's Software Engineering Flex Program. Special thanks to everyone at Flatiron who helped me through this phase!
